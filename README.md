# Bayesian Optimization in Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Bayesian Optimization in Machine Learning** project on GitHub! This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview and implementation of Bayesian optimization techniques for optimizing machine learning models.

## Introduction
Bayesian optimization is a powerful approach for optimizing the hyperparameters of machine learning models. It combines the principles of Bayesian inference and optimization to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space and find the optimal set of hyperparameters for a given machine learning task. By leveraging probabilistic modeling and Bayesian reasoning, Bayesian optimization reduces the number of evaluations needed to find the best configuration, making it especially useful for computationally expensive tasks.

## Features
- Integration with popular machine learning frameworks such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
- Performance comparison with other optimization methods

Let's optimize our machine learning models with Bayesian methods! Happy coding :))))
